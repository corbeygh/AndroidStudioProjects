This is a collection of all the android applications I've coded using the EntityControlSystem (ECS) software architecture.
I have been using the Ashley Library, found here: https://github.com/libgdx/ashley

If you don't know what ECS, read this article for a basic understanding:

I feel that in the distant future this style of programming (ECS) will replace the traditional hierarchical structure as;
ECS based design is easy to adapt when your requirements change, meaning 2 things:
1.) You don't have to correctly plan the WHOLE program inadvance.
2.) You don't have to waste large amounts of time refractoring in order to adapt for new changes.

This means faster progress when developing a game or a large application.
